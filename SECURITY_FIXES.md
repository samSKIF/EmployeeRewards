# Security Fixes Applied

## Overview
Critical security vulnerabilities have been resolved by removing hardcoded credentials throughout the codebase and implementing environment variable-based configuration.

## Fixed Files

### Frontend Authentication
- `client/src/pages/auth-page.tsx`: Removed hardcoded admin@demo.io and admin123 from form defaults
- `client/src/pages/login.tsx`: Removed hardcoded admin@demo.io and admin123 from login state
- `client/src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`: Removed hardcoded credential validation, now uses provided credentials

### Backend Authentication
- `server/storage.ts`: Removed hardcoded password bypass for admin123 credentials

### Test Scripts
- `test-corporate-login.js`: Replaced hardcoded corp_admin/SecurePassword123! with environment variables
- `test-corporate-access.js`: Replaced hardcoded credentials with environment variables
- `test-create-corporate-admin.js`: Replaced hardcoded credentials with environment variables

### Setup Scripts
- `setup-tenant-companies.js`: Replaced hardcoded admin@demo.io references with environment variables
- `create-saas-sample-data.js`: Replaced hardcoded ThrivioAdmin2024!, Canva2024Admin!, Monday2024Admin!, Loylogic2024Admin! with environment variables
- `test-duplicate-validation.js`: Replaced hardcoded password123 credentials with environment variables

## Environment Variables Required

For proper authentication, set these environment variables:

```bash
# Corporate Admin Credentials
CORP_ADMIN_USERNAME=your_corp_admin_username
CORP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
CORP_ADMIN_EMAIL=your_corp_admin_email
CORP_ADMIN_NAME=your_corp_admin_name

# System Admin Credentials
ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email
THRIVIO_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_thrivio_admin_password

# Company-Specific Admin Passwords
CANVA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_canva_admin_password
MONDAY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_monday_admin_password
LOYLOGIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_loylogic_admin_password

# Test Environment Credentials
TEST_USER_PASSWORD=your_test_user_password
```

## Security Improvements

1. **No Hardcoded Credentials**: All authentication now requires proper environment configuration
2. **Environment Variable Fallbacks**: Scripts show clear error messages when credentials aren't set
3. **Secure Password Handling**: Removed password bypass logic in authentication verification
4. **Clean Login Forms**: Forms no longer pre-populate with default credentials

## Next Steps

1. Set up proper environment variables in production
2. Generate secure passwords for all admin accounts
3. Implement proper credential rotation policies
4. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication for admin accounts

## Testing

To test the security fixes:
1. Ensure all environment variables are properly set
2. Test login functionality with real credentials
3. Verify that hardcoded defaults no longer work
4. Run test scripts to confirm environment variable usage
