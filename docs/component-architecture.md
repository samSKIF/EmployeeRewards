## Benefits for New Developers

### Clear Mental Model
- **People** = Individual humans in your organization
- **Workspaces** = Virtual spaces where work happens
- **Relationships** = How people connect to workspaces
- **System** = Overall platform management

### Easy Navigation
- Need to add employee feature? Go to `/people/`
- Need to modify space behavior? Go to `/workspaces/`
- Need to change how people join spaces? Go to `/relationships/`
- Need to change system settings? Go to `/system/`

### Prevents Confusion
- No mixing of employee logic with space logic
- Clear separation of concerns
- Each domain has its own data models and business rules
