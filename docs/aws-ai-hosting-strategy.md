# AWS AI Hosting Strategy for ThrivioHR

## AWS AI Service Options

### Option 1: AWS Bedrock (Managed AI Services)
**What it is:** AWS's managed AI service with multiple model options
**Available Models:**
- Claude 3 Sonnet/Haiku (Anthropic)
- Llama 2/3 (Meta) 
- Titan models (Amazon)
- Cohere Command models

**Pricing:**
- Claude 3 Haiku: $0.25 per 1M input tokens, $1.25 per 1M output tokens
- Llama 3 8B: $0.15 per 1M input tokens, $0.20 per 1M output tokens
- 60-80% cheaper than direct OpenAI API

**Benefits:**
- No infrastructure management
- Built-in security and compliance
- Easy scaling
- Multiple model options

### Option 2: EC2 with Self-Hosted Models
**Instance Types for AI:**
- **g5.xlarge**: $1.006/hour (1x NVIDIA A10G, 24GB GPU RAM) - Small deployment
- **g5.2xlarge**: $2.03/hour (1x NVIDIA A10G, 24GB GPU RAM) - Medium deployment  
- **p4d.24xlarge**: $32.77/hour (8x NVIDIA A100, 320GB GPU RAM) - Large deployment

**Cost Comparison (Monthly):**
- g5.xlarge (24/7): ~$730/month - Handles 50-100 employees
- g5.2xlarge (24/7): ~$1,470/month - Handles 200-500 employees
- Spot instances: 50-90% discount (handles interruptions)

### Option 3: AWS SageMaker (ML Platform)
**What it is:** Fully managed machine learning platform
**Features:**
- Model hosting and deployment
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- A/B testing for different models
- Built-in monitoring

**Pricing:**
- ml.g5.xlarge: $1.515/hour for real-time inference
- Batch processing: $0.50-1.00 per 1000 requests
- Serverless inference: Pay per request (no idle costs)

### Option 4: Hybrid AWS + Local
**Architecture:**
- Local Llama models for simple tasks
- AWS Bedrock for complex reasoning
- AWS Lambda for request routing
- CloudFront for global low-latency access

## Recommended AWS Architecture

### Production Setup:
```
Internet → CloudFront → API Gateway → Lambda (Router)
                                    ├── Bedrock (Complex tasks)
                                    ├── SageMaker (Custom models)  
                                    └── EC2 Self-hosted (Simple tasks)
```

### Development Setup:
```
ThrivioHR App → AWS Bedrock Claude 3 Haiku
              → Cost: ~$200-500/month for testing
```

## Cost Analysis by Company Size

### Small Company (100 employees)
**Option A: AWS Bedrock Only**
- Estimated usage: 50K requests/month
- Cost: ~$150-300/month
- Pros: Simple, managed, scalable
- Cons: Higher per-request cost

**Option B: EC2 g5.xlarge + Bedrock**
- EC2 costs: ~$730/month
- Bedrock costs: ~$50/month (complex tasks only)
- Total: ~$780/month
- Pros: More control, better for high volume
- Cons: Infrastructure management

### Medium Company (500 employees)
**Recommended: Hybrid Approach**
- SageMaker endpoint: ~$1,100/month
- Bedrock for complex tasks: ~$200/month
- Lambda routing: ~$50/month
- Total: ~$1,350/month
- Handles: 250K+ requests/month

### Large Company (2000+ employees)
**Recommended: Multi-Region Setup**
- Primary region: p4d.24xlarge spot instance (~$5,000/month)
- Secondary region: g5.2xlarge (~$1,470/month)
- Bedrock fallback: ~$500/month
- Total: ~$6,970/month
- Handles: 1M+ requests/month

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Start with AWS Bedrock (Week 1-2)
**Quick Setup:**
1. Enable AWS Bedrock in your account
2. Request access to Claude 3 Haiku model
3. Create API integration in ThrivioHR
4. Deploy recognition nudge system

**Code Example:**
```typescript
import { BedrockRuntime } from '@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime';

const bedrock = new BedrockRuntime({ region: 'us-east-1' });

async function generateRecognitionNudge(userName: string, lastRecognition: Date) {
  const prompt = `Generate a friendly nudge for ${userName} who last gave recognition ${lastRecognition}`;
  
  const response = await bedrock.invokeModel({
    modelId: 'anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      anthropic_version: 'bedrock-2023-05-31',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
      max_tokens: 200
    })
  });
  
  return JSON.parse(response.body).content[0].text;
}
```

### Phase 2: Add SageMaker Endpoints (Month 2-3)
**Custom Model Deployment:**
1. Fine-tune Llama 3 on your company data
2. Deploy to SageMaker endpoint
3. Route simple requests to custom model
4. Keep Bedrock for complex tasks

### Phase 3: Optimize and Scale (Month 4+)
**Advanced Features:**
1. Multi-model routing based on request complexity
2. A/B testing different models
3. Performance monitoring and optimization
4. Cost optimization with spot instances

## Security and Compliance

### AWS Security Features:
- **VPC isolation**: AI models run in private network
- **IAM permissions**: Fine-grained access control
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **CloudTrail**: Full audit logging
- **Compliance**: SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR ready

### Data Privacy:
- Employee data never leaves your AWS account
- Models can be deployed in specific regions
- No data sharing with model providers
- Complete control over data processing

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Spot Instances (50-90% savings)
- Use for non-critical batch processing
- Automatic failover to on-demand instances
- Perfect for training and fine-tuning

### 2. Reserved Instances (30-60% savings)
- 1-3 year commitments for predictable workloads
- Significant discounts for steady-state usage

### 3. Serverless Inference
- Pay only when AI is actually being used
- No idle costs during low-usage periods
- Perfect for smaller deployments

### 4. Request Batching
- Group multiple requests together
- Reduce API call overhead
- Lower per-request costs
