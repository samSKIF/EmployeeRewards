# ThrivioHR Documentation

## 📋 Architecture Documentation

For comprehensive system architecture and development standards, refer to these primary documents:

### Core Architecture Documents
- **[SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](../SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Complete system architecture, service boundaries, code standards, and migration strategy
- **[replit.md](../replit.md)** - Project overview, user preferences, current status, and development guidelines

These documents serve as the single source of truth for all architectural decisions and must be reviewed before any development work.

## 📁 Additional Documentation

This `docs/` directory contains supplementary documentation including:

- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI specifications and endpoint documentation
- **Development Guides**: Setup instructions, coding standards, and best practices  
- **Testing Standards**: Coverage requirements and testing strategies
- **Security Guidelines**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection standards
- **Deployment Instructions**: Container setup, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure requirements

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Read the architecture docs first**: Start with [SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](../SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) and [replit.md](../replit.md)
2. **Check current migration status**: Review the microservices migration progress
3. **Follow compliance checklist**: Validate all changes against architecture standards
4. **Maintain test coverage**: Meet minimum thresholds (BL 85%, API 90%, Security 100%)
