# Microservices Migration Tracker
**Start Date:** August 7, 2025  
**Target Completion:** 4-6 weeks  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Phase 1

## Migration Strategy
Using **Strangler Fig Pattern** - Building new services alongside existing system, gradually redirecting traffic.

## Phase 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETED (August 7, 2025)
- [x] Created service directory structure
- [x] Built Event Bus for async communication
- [x] Created API Gateway infrastructure
- [x] Developed Base Service template
- [x] Established service registry pattern

### Foundation Components Created:
1. **Event Bus** (`/services/shared/event-bus.ts`)
   - Event-driven communication
   - Event store for sourcing
   - Dead letter queue for resilience
   - Metrics and monitoring

2. **API Gateway** (`/services/api-gateway/`)
   - Single entry point
   - Service routing
   - Rate limiting
   - Health checks
   - Service discovery

3. **Base Service** (`/services/shared/base-service.ts`)
   - Common functionality
   - Health checks
   - Metrics collection
   - Graceful shutdown
   - Event publishing/subscribing

## Phase 2: Employee Core Service Migration ✅ IN PROGRESS (August 7, 2025)
**Source:** `/server/features/employee-management/`
**Target:** `/services/employee-core/`
**Database:** PostgreSQL (employee_core_db)
**Port:** 3001

### Tasks:
- [x] Create service structure
- [x] Set up database with Drizzle ORM
- [x] Migrate authentication logic
- [x] Migrate user management
- [x] Migrate department management
- [ ] Implement org chart
- [x] Create event publishers
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
- [x] Update API Gateway routing - COMPLETED
- [ ] Dual-write for gradual migration

### Completed Components:
- **Authentication Service** - JWT, login, password management
- **User Repository** - Full CRUD with soft deletes
- **Department Management** - CRUD operations
- **Event Publishing** - All state changes publish events
- **Database Schema** - Complete with relations
- **API Routes** - Auth, employees, departments
- **Base Service Integration** - Health checks, metrics
- **API Gateway Configuration** - Routes configured for all services
- **Service Launcher** - Orchestrates microservice startup

## Phase 3: HR Operations Service Migration 🔜 PLANNED
**Source:** `/server/features/leave-management/` + `/server/microservices/leave/`
**Target:** `/services/hr-operations/`
**Database:** PostgreSQL (hr_operations_db)

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create service structure
- [ ] Consolidate leave management code
- [ ] Separate database
- [ ] Implement leave workflows
- [ ] Add performance management stubs
- [ ] Create event publishers
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Update routing

## Phase 4: Recognition & Rewards Service Migration 🔜 PLANNED
**Source:** `/server/features/recognition-system/` + `/server/microservices/recognition/`
**Target:** `/services/recognition-rewards/`
**Database:** PostgreSQL (recognition_db) + Redis

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create service structure
- [ ] Consolidate recognition logic
- [ ] Implement points ledger
- [ ] Add badge system
- [ ] Create leaderboards
- [ ] Set up Redis caching
- [ ] Add event publishers
- [ ] Add tests

## Phase 5: Social Engagement Service Migration 🔜 PLANNED
**Source:** Multiple locations
- `/server/features/social-system/`
- `/server/features/interest-channels/`
- `/server/microservices/social/`
- `/server/microservices/interests/`

**Target:** `/services/social-engagement/`
**Database:** MongoDB (social_engagement_db)

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create service structure
- [ ] Set up MongoDB
- [ ] Migrate social posts/comments
- [ ] Migrate interest groups
- [ ] Migrate channels
- [ ] Implement activity feeds
- [ ] Add event publishers
- [ ] Add tests

## Services NOT Being Migrated (Need Requirements):
- ❌ **Marketplace Service** - Awaiting requirements
- ❌ **Onboarding Service** - Awaiting requirements  
- ❌ **Communication Service** - Awaiting requirements
- ❌ **Analytics Service** - Can be added later

## Migration Principles
1. **Zero Downtime** - All 402 users stay operational
2. **Gradual Rollout** - Use feature flags
3. **Backward Compatible** - Maintain existing APIs during transition
4. **Event-Driven** - All state changes publish events
5. **Database per Service** - Complete data isolation
6. **95% Test Coverage** - Comprehensive testing

## Current System Mapping

| Existing Location | New Service | Status |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| `/server/features/employee-management/` | Employee Core | 🔜 Next |
| `/server/features/leave-management/` | HR Operations | 📋 Planned |
| `/server/microservices/leave/` | HR Operations | 📋 Planned |
| `/server/features/recognition-system/` | Recognition & Rewards | 📋 Planned |
| `/server/microservices/recognition/` | Recognition & Rewards | 📋 Planned |
| `/server/features/social-system/` | Social Engagement | 📋 Planned |
| `/server/features/interest-channels/` | Social Engagement | 📋 Planned |
| `/server/microservices/social/` | Social Engagement | 📋 Planned |
| `/server/microservices/interests/` | Social Engagement | 📋 Planned |

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Foundation infrastructure created
- 🔄 1/4 services migrated (Employee Core in progress)
- ⏳ 0% of traffic routed through new services (testing phase)
- ✅ Event bus operational
- ✅ Service registry configured
- ⏳ API response time: Target <200ms

## Risk Register
| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|---------|
| Data consistency during migration | Dual-write pattern | Planned |
| Service discovery failures | Health checks + circuit breakers | Implemented |
| Event bus overload | Rate limiting + backpressure | Implemented |
| Database migration errors | Incremental migration + rollback | Planned |

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Employee Core Service structure created
2. ✅ API Gateway configuration completed
3. ⏳ Set up separate database (employee_core_db)
4. ⏳ Run database migration
5. ⏳ Test service endpoints
6. ⏳ Implement dual-write pattern
7. ⏳ Gradual traffic migration
8. ⏳ Add integration tests

## Notes
- Foundation completed successfully
- Event-driven architecture in place
- Ready to begin service migrations
- Focusing on existing features only
- New features (marketplace, onboarding) deferred until requirements ready
