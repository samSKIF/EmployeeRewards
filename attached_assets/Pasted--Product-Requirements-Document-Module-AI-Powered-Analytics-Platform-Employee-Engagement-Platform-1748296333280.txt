Engagement risk prediction precision	>75%
Survey insight clustering accuracy	>80% satisfaction
Nudge acceptance rate	>30%
Usage of conversational queries	50+ monthly queries by HR

4. Core Features & Functional Requirements
4.1. Engagement Prediction Engine
Description:
AI model monitors behavioral signals (posting frequency, likes given/received, recognitions received, etc.) and flags employees or teams at risk of disengagement or attrition.

Inputs:

User activity logs

Recognition events

Survey participation history

Comment/post counts over time

Outputs:

Risk score per user/team

Weekly ‚ÄúEngagement Health‚Äù report to HR

List of flagged users by team/department

Tech Stack:

Python (scikit-learn or XGBoost)

Scheduled jobs (daily or weekly)

Data stored in Firebase or PostgreSQL

4.2. Sentiment & Topic Analysis (NLU)
Description:
Natural Language Understanding (NLU) layer analyzes employee-generated content (posts, comments, survey responses) for sentiment and trending topics.

Functionality:

Sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative) per post or survey

Trending topic detection using keyword clustering (e.g., ‚Äútoo many meetings‚Äù, ‚Äúneed better tools‚Äù)

Dashboard view by team or timeframe

Tools:

OpenAI or HuggingFace transformers

Sentiment: Finetuned BERT model

Topic modeling: LDA or BERTopic

4.3. AI-Powered Survey Analysis
Description:
Automated clustering and summarization of open-text survey responses.

Functionality:

Group similar feedback using vector embeddings

Generate TL;DR summaries of large surveys

Label themes like "Work-life balance", "Managerial support"

Output Format:

Survey Summary Report PDF + Dashboard

Bar chart of frequency by theme

Library Options:

Sentence-BERT + KMeans

GPT summary prompt engine

4.4. Personalized Nudges & Recommendations
Description:
Micro-interventions based on data triggers (e.g., inactivity, zero recognitions, negative feedback)

Nudge Examples:

‚ÄúHey Alex, Sam hasn‚Äôt been recognized in 30 days. Want to send a thank you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour team‚Äôs sentiment dropped 20% this week ‚Äî consider a feedback round?‚Äù

Delivery Mechanism:

In-app notification

4.5. AI-Powered ROI Analytics for HR
Description:
Showcase business value of engagement activities via correlation analytics.

Examples:

‚ÄúEmployees recognized 2+ times/month had 35% higher retention‚Äù

‚ÄúSurvey satisfaction ‚Üë10pts ‚Üí Productivity ‚Üë12%‚Äù

Method:

Simple linear regressions for MVP

Visualization in dashboard (line, bar, correlation heatmaps)

4.6. Smart Dashboards with Conversational AI
Description:
Let users ask questions in natural language and get instant insights.

Examples:

"Which department has the most engagement this month?"
"Show me sentiment trends in Sales over last quarter"

UX Flow:

Text input ‚Üí API call ‚Üí Answer + chart/graph

Option to export result as PDF

Stack:

Description:
Monitor data for potential bias patterns in recognition, feedback, and sentiment.

Features:

Heatmap showing recognition count by gender/nationality/team

Alert when any group receives <50% of average recognitions

Weekly equity audit email to HR

Data Inputs:

Demographics (from user profile)

Recognition logs, sentiment logs

Models:

No complex ML required for MVP ‚Äî use statistical anomaly detection

5. User Roles
