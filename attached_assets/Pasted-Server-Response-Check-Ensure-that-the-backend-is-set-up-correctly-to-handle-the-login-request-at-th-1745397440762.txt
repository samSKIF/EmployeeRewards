Server Response Check: Ensure that the backend is set up correctly to handle the login request at the /api/auth/login endpoint. You need to check if the server is receiving the login request and how it's processing the credentials.

In your useAuth.tsx file, you might want to add additional logging in the server response handling part to see exactly what's going wrong:

const response = await fetch("/api/auth/login", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(loginData),
  credentials: "include"
});
console.log("Login response status:", response.status, response.statusText);
const responseText = await response.text();
console.log("Raw response:", responseText);
if (!response.ok) {
  console.error("Login error response:", responseText);
  throw new Error(`Login failed: ${response.status} ${responseText}`);
}
Backend Logic Validation: Check the logic in your authentication route in your server code (probably found in your server/routes.ts file). You need to ensure that the credentials (email and password) are correct and that the server properly validates them against your database or authentication mechanism.

Make sure to log the received credentials and the matching outcome to diagnose the issue:

app.post("/api/auth/login", async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  console.log("Received login data:", { email, password });
  // Add the logic to validate user credentials here.
});
Network Issues: If your backend code is correct, check if there are any network issues or misconfigurations that prevent the client from connecting to the server. You can test this by sending a direct request to the /api/auth/login endpoint using a tool like Postman and see if you receive the expected response.

Error Handling: In the frontend, you can enhance error handling in your login procedure to debug the issue more effectively. When login fails, log the error message you receive to get clearer insight into the matter.
