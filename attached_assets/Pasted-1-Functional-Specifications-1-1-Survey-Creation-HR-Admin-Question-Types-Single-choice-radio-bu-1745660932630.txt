4. Visual Style & Components

Components:

Cards for survey listings

Modals or Panels for survey taking

Wizard Stepper component for creation flow

Charts (bar, pie, word cloud) in analytics

Buttons: primary (Publish/Submit), secondary (Save/Back)

Responsiveness: single-column on mobile, two-column on tablet+, floating action button (FAB) for “New Survey.”

5. Example User Journey
HR Admin logs into Dashboard → clicks New Survey → uses Wizard to build a 5-question pulse survey → schedules it for Monday at 9 AM → publishes.

Employee opens Social feed Monday morning → sees a Survey Card → clicks Take Survey → answers questions (progress bar marches forward) → clicks Submit → sees “Thank you!” and receives Reward Points.

HR Admin later that day checks Analytics → sees 40% response rate, flags low satisfaction on Q3 → exports data → shares with leadership.
